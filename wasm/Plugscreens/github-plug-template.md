## Thank you for playing Gardens of Kadesh
This WebAssembly port of Homeworld is based on HomeworldSDL. HomeworldSDL in turn is based on the original Homeworld source code released by Relic Entertainment in 2003. This build only uses the assets provided in the freely distributed Homeworld demo and as such is limited in scope to the first two single player missions.

If you enjoyed playing please support the developers and follow the links below to check out the Homeworld 3 fig campaign and the Homeworld Remastered collection.

To get involved with the development of Gardens of Kadesh or HomeworldSDL feel free to join our discord and checkout the github repository below.










## Dear Embracer Group, Gearbox Software, Blackbird Interactive, Relic Entertainment,
unfortunately the Homeworld source code was released under an unfavorable Relic Developer Network License. The disappearance of the Relic Developer Network and the Homeworld IP having changed hands leaves the license state of the Homeworld source code in a dubious state that hinders development.
Please reach out and consider re-releasing the original Homeworld source code under GPL2/3 or re-licensing the current GardenOfKadesh/HomeworldSDL code under GPL2/3.
